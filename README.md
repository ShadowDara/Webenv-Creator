# Webenv-Creator

*Yeah, you need lua for this ;)*

***Please: Only us this for new project, the script eventually
delete something!!!***

Copy one of the `.lua` files in your new project
folder and run it with lua.

## Requirements

- Lua
- Python
- Batch

## Info

This is a simple lua script which creates a web envirment
for you. After running the script the in your new project
folder, some new files will be created!

run `create_web_env.lua` and then there should be new files!


## Then to use

run `start.bat` to create a local HTTP Server
in your project folder

This will start a `HTTP Server` with Python in the root directory
*(if python is installed and as a envirment var)*

then the script will open the `localhost`on PORT: `8000` in your
main browser for `.htm` files

then it will open your project folder in `Visual Studio Code`

***Explanation for other VSCode down below***


## Your folder path should now look like this

```
'project-root-folder'/

    dev_envirment_dara/

        localhost.8000.htm
        other_vs_code.md

    start.bat

    index.html
    404.html
```

*ignore it, if you have already renamed the `other_vs_code.md`
file to `other_vs_code`, i can't show both of them ;)*

**The HTTP Server will run until you close the terminal!**

**Note**

the better HTTP Server does not start PORT `8000` when Port
`8000` is busy, then the server will search for a new free
Port and display the new Port in the Python console


## Other VSCode

If you have installed VSCode in another directory and
want to use this installation, change the name of this
file from `other_vs_code.md` to `other_vs_code` and
open the `run_server_for_testing.bat` file and check
line 10.

```
start "" "C:\D4R4\.can_delete\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe" "%cd%"
```

`C:\D4R4\.can_delete\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe` is the
used folder path, replace it with your folder path.


## Why there are 2 404 files

The `404-2.html` redirects you directly back to the homepage, personally
i like this method. Just rename it to `404.html` and the delete the old
`404.html` or delete the `404-2.html` file!
